    <p>

        wonderful. You won't have to drain any grease from the patties once they've <br>
        browned. Serve over mashed potatoes, egg noodles, or rice. Simply delightful!

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Gather the ingredients.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make the patties: Mix ground sirloin, panko bread crumbs, egg, milk, 1/2 packet <br>
                onion soup mix, Worcestershire sauce, and black pepper together in a large <br>
                bowl; shape into 5 patties.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat a skillet over medium heat. Cook patties in the hot skillet until browned, 3 <br>
                to 5 minutes per side.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make the gravy: Melt butter in a separate skillet over medium-high heat. Sauté <br>
                mushrooms and onion in melted butter until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir flour <br>
                and remaining 1/2 packet onion soup mix into mushroom mixture until <br>
                combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                Gradually add beef stock and water, stirring continually, until simmering. <br>
                Reduce heat to medium; cook, stirring frequently, until gravy has thickened, <br>
                about 4 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place browned patties into gravy; simmer until very tender, about 30 minutes. <br>
                An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F <br>
                (70 degrees C).
            </li>
        </ol>
